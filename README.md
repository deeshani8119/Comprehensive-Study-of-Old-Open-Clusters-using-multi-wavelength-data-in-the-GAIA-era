ABSTRACT-
 This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the properties of old open clusters using multi-wavelength data in the GAIA era. Open clusters offer a unique opportunity to study the intricacies of galaxy formation and evolution due to their similar ages and chemical compositions as they are formed from the same molecular clouds. Recent studies have shed light on the internal structures, kinematics, and physical properties of open clusters such as Berkeley 26, Berkeley 45, Berkeley 70, NGC 2266, and Tombaugh 4, providing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of stellar systems. In this study, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of these clusters, including the determination of age by fitting the theoretical PARSEC isochrone models to the observed CMDs for stars upto G-mag $\le 20$, metallicity, distance, reddening by fitting ZAMS from Caldwell (1993), estimation of radial density profiles by fitting KING's model, luminosity function and metallicity using GAIA EDR3, 2MASS, and LAMOST data. We will also discuss the probable blue straggler stars (BSS) in these clusters near the Main Sequence Turn Off point (MSTO). Furthermore, we will also determine the mean proper motion and parallaxes associated with these clusters. Our investigation aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the broader aspects of galaxy formation and evolution, essential to enhance our knowledge of the Milky Way's galactic disk and its intricate evolutionary history
